Major assignment 
These are the observations I want to make:

# Group code
Please note that I started with the original "Group F - General Code", which includes a slight difference in the function setup regarding colours. Moving forward I used the same code as Chiara and Jack's "Group F - Code Final" but did not manage to upload it in the final commit. The code itself should be the same though as the rest of the group apart from the file name.
